    "**Scenario:** You are building an automated ordering system for **Green Bites**, a healthy salad bowl shop. Customers send messy messages like \"I want a kale salad with extra avocado, oh and a ginger kombucha, send it to my office at 123 Main St\". You need to turn this into a structured JSON for your kitchen and delivery systems.\n",
